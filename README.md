## Introduction

This repository presents an **interpretable AI-ECG model** designed to directly predict **severe stenosis** or **complete occlusion** of the four major coronary arteries — **RCA, LM, LAD, LCX** — as defined by **coronary CT angiography (CCTA)**, using only 12-lead ECG signals.

By fine-tuning **ECGFounder**, the world’s largest ECG foundation model, the project demonstrates AI-ECG's potential as a **non-invasive, low-cost screening tool** for occult CAD, even among patients with clinically normal ECGs.

---

## Key Contributions

### 1. Direct prediction of vessel-level CCTA lesions

The first interpretable AI-ECG system capable of **direct vessel-specific prediction** of severe stenosis or complete occlusion.

### 2. Screening for occult CAD

The model maintains strong performance in the **normal ECG subgroup**, revealing underlying disease patterns.

### 3. Dynamic risk stratification

Combining predicted risk with incidence curves enables **prospective coronary event risk stratification**.

### 4. Waveform-level interpretability

Waveform comparison highlights **key electrophysiological regions** that differentiate high-risk vs. low-risk groups.

## Model Performance

AUC scores across internal, external, and normal-ECG validation.

| Vessel  | Internal AUC | External AUC | Normal-ECG AUC |
| ------- | ------------ | ------------ | -------------- |
| **RCA** | 0.794        | 0.749        | 0.793          |
| **LM**  | 0.818        | 0.971        | 0.896          |
| **LAD** | 0.744        | 0.667        | 0.707          |
| **LCX** | 0.755        | 0.727        | 0.765          |

> Note: LM performance may be inflated due to low lesion prevalence.

## Model Architecture & Training Strategy

### Foundation Model

* **ECGFounder**, pretrained for myocardial infarction prediction.

### Backbone Network

* Modified **Net1D** for ECG representation.

### Multi-Task Learning

Joint prediction of the four arteries to enhance shared feature extraction.

### Optimization Techniques

* **Uncertainty-based adaptive task weighting**
* **PCGrad** to resolve gradient conflicts in multi-task training
